Some ideas for rituals:

- A ritual that slows the day/night cycle for some ammount of time.

- A ritual that creates a bubble of protection. Any mobs that enter are put into a team with players in the bubble so players are not tarketed.

- A ritual that prevents a user from both taking and dealing damage for a time.

- Rituals that buff armaments and items? (infinite durability for a short duration? Extra Strength, etc.)

- Corrupted Rituals. (Maybe nether spread/coruption)

- LOOT Rituals - trade some rare items for random loot that has a chance to be exceptional.

- Add random structures such as decrepit dungeons and corrupted altars that spread sculk
